## Coffee Bot - learning python (plus learning git)
To begin learning python I figured why not also learn source control and git at the same time. 
Par for the course when I try to learn something. I try to eat the elephant in one sitting. 


The Coffee Bot program was originally the idea of NetworkChuck (https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck) on youtube. I've since taken this project in a different direction. 
I have a hard time waiting for updates on the video series. Plus I have a few more advanced ideas I would like to attempt. Namely using JSON to organize my menu options with product names, prices, and other values.
